# Data Directory

This directory should contain your precipitation data files.

## Expected Data Format

Your CSV file should have the following columns:
- `year`: Year (e.g., 2020)
- `month`: Month (1-12)
- `precipitation`: Precipitation amount in mm

## Example

```csv
year,month,precipitation
1987,10,0
1987,11,0
1987,12,0
1988,1,9.8
...
You can upload your Monthly.csv file to this directory.
